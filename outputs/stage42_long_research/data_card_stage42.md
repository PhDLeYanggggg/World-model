# Stage42 Data Card

- datasets audited: `7`
- external domains ready from existing state: `['opentraj', 'eth_ucy', 'trajnet', 'ucy']`
- metric claim ready datasets: `['tgsim']`
- seconds claim ready datasets: `[]`
- global metric claim allowed: `False`
- global seconds claim allowed: `False`

## Data Roles

- SDD: pixel-space official benchmark evidence from earlier stages.
- External top-down trajectories: dataset-local raw-frame external validation for Stage42.
- TGSIM: diagnostic traffic unit/metric evidence only, not pedestrian official success.

## Leakage Policy

Future endpoints/waypoints are labels/evaluation only. No central velocity, no test endpoint goal construction, and no test threshold tuning are allowed.

<!-- STAGE42_AC_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-AC Latest Evidence Refresh

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_wxyz_aa_ab_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- Stage42-AB is now included as auxiliary-head evidence.
- Auxiliary-head conclusion: mixed / partial; not a uniform main contribution claim.
- Stage5C and SMC remain disabled.

### Data-Card Update

No new metric/time calibration was introduced by Stage42-AB/AC. All updated paper-package claims remain dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D.

<!-- STAGE42_AJ_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-AJ Post-Repair Paper Package Refresh

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_ad_to_ai_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- This refresh supersedes stale Stage42-AE limitations: horizon=25 harm, ETH_UCY t50/FDE, and TrajNet|100 easy safety were repaired by validation-only guards.
- t100 remains raw-frame diagnostic; metric/seconds/true-3D/foundation/Stage5C/SMC claims remain rejected.
- Future waypoints/endpoints remain labels/eval only, never inference inputs.

### Post-Repair Headline Metrics

- ADE all CI low: `0.085978`
- ADE t50 CI low: `0.058513`
- ADE t100 raw-frame diagnostic CI low: `0.068349`

### Claim Boundary

- Supported: protected row-level full-waypoint raw-frame 2.5D world-state evidence with positive all/t50/hard/FDE@50 lower bounds and repaired t100 easy-safety diagnostic.
- Supported as non-harm only: horizon=25 floor/non-harm slices; do not call them positive dynamics contributions.
- Rejected: metric prediction, seconds-level horizon, true 3D, foundation model, Stage5C execution, SMC readiness, and ungated neural deployment.

### Claim Boundary

- Supported: protected t50 slice repair with bootstrap evidence for `TrajNet|50` and `UCY|50`.
- Still required: teacher/floor rollout context, protected safe-switch, train/internal-validation policy selection.
- Rejected: true 3D, foundation model, global metric prediction, seconds-level horizon, Stage5C execution, SMC readiness, and ungated/floor-free neural deployment.

<!-- STAGE42_DR_POST_DQ_PAPER_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-DR Post-DP/DQ Paper Evidence Refresh

- source: `fresh_paper_refresh_from_stage42_dp_dq_dn_do`
- role: synchronize paper-ready evidence after the fresh context-closure and full-waypoint-promotion checkpoints.
- This is not new training and not a threshold search; it updates claim hygiene and paper artifacts.

### Context Claim Boundary

- closure decision: `close_current_sequence_graph_residual_context_protocol`.
- best context deltas vs baseline-family control all/t50/hard: `-2.30%` / `-8.31%` / `-2.62%`.
- positive context rows: `[]`.
- Paper wording: sequence/graph/neighbor/goal context remains auxiliary or diagnostic under the current residual protocol, not an independent main contribution.

### Full-Waypoint Runtime Evidence

- runtime all/t50/t100 raw/hard vs train-horizon causal floor: `24.72%` / `22.36%` / `14.35%` / `23.89%`.
- runtime easy degradation: `-25.63%`; switch rate: `58.81%`.
- exact replay: switch `True`, selected_xy max abs diff `0.0`.
- near@0.05 base/final/floor: `1.94%` / `1.38%` / `2.24%`.
- Paper wording: protected source-level group-consistency full-waypoint runtime policy is valid evidence, but ungated full-waypoint and global primary replacement remain blocked.

### Deployment Variant Boundary

- safety-sensitive default: `proximity_guard`.
- accuracy-priority diagnostic: `no_proximity_guard`.
- source-level full-waypoint runtime candidate: `group_consistency_full_waypoint_runtime`.
- baseline mixing caveat: `True`.

### Source / Time / Metric Boundary

- conversion-ready targets: `0`; converted now: `0`; evaluated now: `0`.
- global metric/seconds claim allowed: `False`.
- global t100 deployable claim allowed: `False`.
- Paper wording: dataset-local/raw-frame only unless future source/legal/time calibration closes the blocker.

### Non-Claims

- Do not claim true 3D.
- Do not claim foundation world model.
- Do not claim global metric or seconds-level prediction.
- Do not claim Stage5C execution.
- Do not claim SMC readiness.

- Source conversion remains blocked: conversion_ready_now `0`, converted/evaluated now `0` / `0`.

- teacher_floor_rollout_context_removal_allowed: `False`.
