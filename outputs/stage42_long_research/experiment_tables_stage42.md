- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- Stage42-AB is now included as auxiliary-head evidence.
- Auxiliary-head conclusion: mixed / partial; not a uniform main contribution claim.

## Stage42-AJ Post-Repair Paper Package Refresh

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_ad_to_ai_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- This refresh supersedes stale Stage42-AE limitations: horizon=25 harm, ETH_UCY t50/FDE, and TrajNet|100 easy safety were repaired by validation-only guards.
- t100 remains raw-frame diagnostic; metric/seconds/true-3D/foundation/Stage5C/SMC claims remain rejected.
- Future waypoints/endpoints remain labels/eval only, never inference inputs.

### Post-Repair Headline Metrics

- ADE all CI low: `0.085978`
- ADE t50 CI low: `0.058513`
- ADE t100 raw-frame diagnostic CI low: `0.068349`
- ADE hard/failure CI low: `0.090662`

### Claim Boundary

- Supported: protected row-level full-waypoint raw-frame 2.5D world-state evidence with positive all/t50/hard/FDE@50 lower bounds and repaired t100 easy-safety diagnostic.
- Supported as non-harm only: horizon=25 floor/non-harm slices; do not call them positive dynamics contributions.
- Rejected: metric prediction, seconds-level horizon, true 3D, foundation model, Stage5C execution, SMC readiness, and ungated neural deployment.
<!-- STAGE42_AJ_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CA_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CA Post-BZ Paper Evidence Refresh

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_by_bz_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- Stage42-BY repaired the protected t50 slices; Stage42-BZ adds bootstrap evidence.
- This is protected policy evidence under the Stage37/teacher floor, not floor-free neural world dynamics.
- t+50/t+100 remain raw-frame horizons; no global metric or seconds-level claim is allowed.
- Stage5C remains unexecuted and SMC remains disabled.

### Post-BZ Headline Evidence

- selected variant: `family_baseline_rel_only`
- internal validation group: `UCY::UCY/zara03/crowds_zara03.txt`
- robust t50 slices: `TrajNet|50, UCY|50`
- target union t50 CI: `[28.52%, 29.45%]`
- target union hard/failure CI low: `28.51%`
- target union easy degradation CI high: `-25.16%`
- bootstrap_n: `3000`

### Claim Boundary

- Supported: protected t50 slice repair with bootstrap evidence for `TrajNet|50` and `UCY|50`.
- Still required: teacher/floor rollout context, protected safe-switch, train/internal-validation policy selection.
- Rejected: true 3D, foundation model, global metric prediction, seconds-level horizon, Stage5C execution, SMC readiness, and ungated/floor-free neural deployment.

<!-- STAGE42_CL_CONTEXT_GUARD_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CL Post-CJ/CK Context Guard Refresh

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_cj_ck_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- Stage42-CJ tested whether goal/scene context can become a validation-only gated expert over baseline-family rollout context.
- Stage42-CK tested whether scalar neighbor or kNN interaction graph context can become a validation-only gated expert.
- Both gates selected `baseline_family_control`, so goal/scene and neighbor/interaction remain diagnostic/auxiliary rather than main claims.
- This refresh updates paper-package language to prevent context overclaims.
- Stage5C remains unexecuted and SMC remains disabled.

### Evidence Rows

### Claim Boundary

- Supported main mechanism remains baseline-family rollout context plus causal history under a conservative safety floor.
- Goal/scene context is not a standalone main contribution under the current source-level ridge/full-waypoint protocol.
- Neighbor/interaction context is not a standalone main contribution under the current source-level ridge/full-waypoint protocol.
- Rejected: true 3D, foundation model, global metric prediction, seconds-level horizon, Stage5C execution, SMC readiness, and ungated/floor-free neural deployment.

<!-- STAGE42_CM_FULL_WAYPOINT_BRIDGE_SHAPE_AUDIT:START -->
## Stage42-CM Endpoint Bridge / Full-Waypoint Shape Audit

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_full_waypoint_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D full-waypoint evidence boundary.
- Endpoint-only FDE is diagnostic; endpoint success cannot be counted as full-waypoint world-state success.
- Protected full-waypoint sequence dynamics has horizon/full-waypoint evidence, but the endpoint linear bridge remains stronger on all-ADE.
- Graph/group consistency has positive protected metrics but still carries a proximity caveat and is not an independent neighbor/interaction main claim after Stage42-CK.
- Stage5C remains unexecuted and SMC remains disabled.

### Key Deltas

- protected full-waypoint minus composite-tail linear bridge: all `-2.45%`, t50 `1.15%`, t100 raw diagnostic `8.16%`, hard `-0.87%`.
- graph/group minus protected full-waypoint: all `3.66%`, t50 `0.29%`, hard `2.89%`, collision_delta_005 `0.00829083972266037`.

Endpoint success cannot be counted as full-waypoint world-state success. |

### Claim Boundary

- Supported: protected full-waypoint raw-frame evidence exists, especially for horizon/full-waypoint slices and unified row-level three-domain package.
- Supported with caveat: graph/group consistency can be useful inside protected policies, but current source-level kNN graph expert did not become a main contribution.
- Rejected: endpoint-only success as full-waypoint success; ungated full-waypoint neural deployment; true 3D; foundation; metric/seconds-level; Stage5C; SMC.
