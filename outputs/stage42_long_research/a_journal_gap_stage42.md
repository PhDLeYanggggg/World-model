# Stage42 A-Journal Gap Analysis

## Current Position

Stage42 is strong enough to support a serious protected 2.5D external world-state dynamics manuscript draft. It is not yet enough for a broad true-3D/foundation/world-model claim.

## What Is Already Paper-Usable

- Fresh source-level external validation.
- Fresh full-waypoint all-agent world-state evaluation.
- Fresh safety-floor study showing why ungated neural cannot be deployed.
- Fresh Stage42-G Phase1 retrained external selector ablations for history, neighbor/interaction, goal/scene, domain expert, safe-switch, and teacher-floor proxy variants.
- Fresh Stage42-H causal temporal sequence ablation showing that history tokens are strongly positive when encoded as a sequence rather than flattened into a ridge-selector feature vector.
- Fresh Stage42-I sequence-to-full-waypoint experiment showing that causal history gives a small positive full-waypoint contribution, while un-gated static/context features currently hurt protected ADE.
- Fresh Stage42-J static-gated full-waypoint repair showing that validation-selected partial-static experts convert the Stage42-I negative full model into positive ADE/FDE full-waypoint evidence while preserving easy cases.
- Fresh Stage42-K static-gated checkpoint training showing that a learned static gate/dropout can be trained directly into a checkpoint and improve over Stage42-I full static+sequence while preserving easy cases.
- Fresh Stage42-L horizon-aware static gate repair showing that t+50-specific gate conditioning fixes the Stage42-K ADE t50 sign while preserving easy cases.
- Fresh Stage42-M policy-distillation negative result showing that coarse domain/horizon alpha distillation is insufficient; row-level gain/harm supervision is needed.
- Fresh Stage42-N row-level gain/harm static-gate pilot showing that row-level alpha supervision improves all/hard but still fails t+50, so alpha-style gate distillation alone is insufficient.
- Fresh Stage42-O explicit gain/harm selector showing that row-level switch/gain/harm prediction improves all/hard and uses train-only normalization, but still does not pass ADE t50.
- Fresh Stage42-P t+50-specific gain/harm selector showing that t+50-weighted train/val supervision repairs the mean ADE t50 sign while preserving all/hard/easy.
- Clear claim boundaries and no-leakage policy.

## What Is Not Yet Strong Enough

- Full retrained ablation for every named component: Stage42-G/H cover key feature/safety selector and causal sequence-history ablations, but JEPA, full Transformer, endpoint-bridge, and full-waypoint-shape retraining remain open.
- Full sequence-to-waypoint deployment: Stage42-L repairs the fresh checkpoint t50 sign, but it still underperforms the Stage42-J policy-level gate. A stronger paper claim still needs distillation of Stage42-J's domain/horizon expert selection into a fresh checkpoint, longer training, or bootstrap over the improved checkpoint.
- Policy distillation and row selector: Stage42-M shows that distilling only slice-level static alpha can improve FDE t50 but harms ADE t50. Stage42-N shows that row-level alpha/gain/harm supervision improves all/hard but still harms ADE t50. Stage42-O shows that an explicit gain/harm selector improves all/hard more cleanly under train-only normalization, but ADE t50 is still slightly negative. Stage42-P repairs the mean ADE t50 sign with t+50-specific weighting, but the 3-seed t50 CI low remains negative, so it still needs statistical strengthening before becoming a paper-level stable t50 claim.
- Metric/time-calibrated pedestrian benchmark claims.
- External expansion beyond the current converted top-down state with independent legal datasets.
- Floor-free or partially floor-free neural deployment that preserves proximity/collision safety.
- Strong JEPA/full-Transformer positive contribution claim; current evidence favors protected bounded dynamics and causal sequence-history modeling over pure JEPA/Transformer.

## Shortest Next Path

1. Add more seeds/bootstrap and per-domain horizon calibration for Stage42-P, because it passes the mean t50 gate but still has negative 3-seed t50 CI low.
2. Run Stage42-G/H Phase2 true retrained ablations for no-JEPA, no-Transformer, no-endpoint-bridge, and no-full-waypoint-shape with bootstrap or three seeds; Stage42-H has repaired the history-token question with an actual sequence model, so the next ablation priority is full Transformer/JEPA/full-waypoint-shape rather than flattened-history.
3. Add one more legally verified external top-down pedestrian/drone dataset or a stronger held-out source split.
4. Build a proximity-safe internal self-gate that reduces teacher-floor dependence without increasing collision/proximity risk.
5. Obtain verified homography/FPS/stride for at least one pedestrian subset, or keep all claims raw-frame/dataset-local.

## Absolute Non-Claims

- Not true 3D.
- Not foundation.
- Not metric/seconds-level pedestrian prediction.
- Not Stage5C or SMC.
- Not ungated neural deployment.

- Need metric/time calibration or continue strict raw-frame language.
- Need broader external legal datasets and stronger floor-reduction evidence before claiming foundation-track generalization.

- Still required: teacher/floor rollout context, protected safe-switch, train/internal-validation policy selection.

## Stage42-CB Source Robustness Caveat

- source: `fresh_stage42_cb_t50_source_robustness_audit`
- verdict: `stage42_cb_t50_source_robustness_pass_with_source_diversity_limit`
- robust major-source slices: `TrajNet|50`, `UCY|50`
- concentration-limited slices: `TrajNet|50`, `UCY|50`
- broad source-level generalization claim allowed: `false`

Stage42-CB strengthens the honesty of the t50 claim: BY/BZ t50 gains are positive on the available major sources, but source diversity is still limited. `TrajNet|50` is dominated by `students003` and `UCY|50` currently has a single test source. This supports a paper claim of protected t50 repair with source-concentration caveat, not a broad source-level generalization claim. The shortest path remains acquiring or legally converting more independent t50-capable external top-down sources.
<!-- STAGE42_CB_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CC_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CC Independent T50 Source Inventory

- source: `fresh_stage42_cc_independent_t50_source_inventory`
- verdict: `stage42_cc_independent_t50_source_inventory_pass`
- scanned files: `93`
- t50-capable files: `10`
- unused independent ready-to-claim t50 sources: `0`
- alternate current-source candidates: `4`
- diagnostic/synthetic t50 candidates: `1`
- source-diversity repair ready: `false`

Stage42-CC confirms that the Stage42-CB source-diversity caveat remains active. The local inventory contains t50-capable files, but the conservative audit does not count any as an unused independent ready-to-claim real external source. Four files are alternate/current-source representations useful for split-rebuild diagnostics, and one file is synthetic/diagnostic. Therefore BY/BZ t50 repair remains paper-usable only with a source-concentration caveat; broad source-level generalization still requires legally enabled independent top-down pedestrian sources followed by conversion, no-leakage audit, validation-only selection, and final test.

### Updated Gap After CC

- Need at least one new independent legal t50-capable external source for source-diversity repair.
- Do not count alternate representations, registry-only paths, or synthetic/diagnostic rows as converted/evaluated external evidence.
- The current A-journal package can claim protected major-source robustness, not broad source-level generalization.
<!-- STAGE42_CC_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CD_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CD Source Diversity Acquisition Package

- source: `fresh_stage42_cd_source_diversity_acquisition_package`
- verdict: `stage42_cd_source_diversity_acquisition_package_pass`
- official targets: `5`
- auto-download targets: `0`
- manual/terms targets: `4`
- local path families found: `4`
- converted datasets now: `0`
- source-diversity repair ready now: `false`
- broad source-level generalization claim allowed: `false`

Stage42-CD converts the CC source-diversity blocker into an actionable acquisition package. It identifies UCY Crowd Data, ETH/BIWI, TrajNet++, OpenTraj toolkit/reference, and an additional legal top-down pedestrian/drone source as the next acquisition/conversion targets. It intentionally performs no automatic download and makes no conversion claim, because the priority targets either require manual terms/path verification or are toolkit/challenge references rather than independent permission to use data.

### Updated Gap After CD

- The next paper-critical data action is not another source-concentrated t50 report; it is legal independent source acquisition plus conversion/no-leakage/source-CV.
- Existing local paths are useful, but current evidence still cannot claim broad source-level generalization.
- A future Stage42 source-diversity repair must start from a user-provided legal local path or verified official terms.
<!-- STAGE42_CD_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CE_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CE Source Diversity Conversion Preflight

- source: `fresh_stage42_ce_source_diversity_conversion_preflight`
- verdict: `stage42_ce_source_diversity_conversion_preflight_pass`
- gates: `12 / 12`
- targets checked: `5`
- targets with local path: `4`
- targets with schema possible: `4`
- targets with t50 files: `3`
- targets with t100 files: `3`
- independent t50 candidates ready to claim: `0`
- source-CV-ready targets now: `0`
- converted datasets now: `0`
- evaluated datasets now: `0`
- source-diversity repair ready now: `false`

Stage42-CE is a useful engineering preflight, not a data-conversion success claim. It shows that UCY/ETH/BIWI/TrajNet/OpenTraj-related local paths are present and often parseable, but the legal/source-identity blockers remain: UCY/ETH/TrajNet still need official terms/path verification, OpenTraj is a toolkit/root scan rather than blanket independent data permission, and no target produces an unused independent ready-to-claim t50 source.

### Updated Gap After CE

- The source-diversity blocker is now narrower: local parseability exists, but legal permission, source identity, and source-CV readiness are still missing.
- Do not count Stage42-CE as converted data, external evaluation, or broad source-level generalization.
- The next valid repair step is legal terms/path verification followed by actual conversion, no-leakage audit, validation-only source-CV selection, and final test once.
<!-- STAGE42_CE_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CF_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CF Source Conversion Legal Gate

- source: `fresh_stage42_cf_source_conversion_legal_gate`
- verdict: `stage42_cf_source_conversion_legal_gate_pass`
- gates: `13 / 13`
- targets checked: `5`
- local paths present: `4`
- schema possible targets: `4`
- targets with t50 files: `3`
- targets with t100 files: `3`
- source-CV-ready targets now: `0`
- conversion allowed now: `0`
- converted datasets now: `0`
- evaluated datasets now: `0`

Stage42-CF turns the Stage42-CE preflight into an enforceable legal/source-identity gate. It deliberately permits no conversion at this time: local parseability is not permission, OpenTraj toolkit/root scans are not independent data rights, and UCY/ETH/TrajNet still need explicit official terms/path verification before any conversion can be counted. The generated terms-confirmation JSON is a checklist only.

### Updated Gap After CF

- The next source-diversity step is no longer ambiguous: fill legal confirmation from official terms, isolate independent source identity, then run actual conversion/no-leakage/source-CV/final test.
- Current paper evidence remains strong for protected dataset-local/raw-frame 2.5D dynamics, but broad source-level generalization is still blocked.
- Do not cite Stage42-CF as data conversion, external validation, metric/time calibration, true-3D evidence, Stage5C readiness, or SMC readiness.
<!-- STAGE42_CF_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CG_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CG Source Terms Confirmation Validator

- source: `fresh_stage42_cg_source_terms_confirmation_validator`
- verdict: `stage42_cg_source_terms_confirmation_validator_pass`
- gates: `11 / 11`
- targets validated: `5`
- terms accepted targets: `0`
- conversion-ready targets: `0`
- converted datasets now: `0`
- evaluated datasets now: `0`

Stage42-CG validates the source terms confirmation template generated by Stage42-CF and writes a machine-readable conversion readiness manifest. The current template is intentionally blank, so all targets remain blocked. This is not a setback; it prevents a serious paper-quality error: local paths and parseable files must not be promoted into legal external validation without explicit official terms/path/source-identity evidence.

### Updated Gap After CG

- The source-diversity repair path now has an enforceable precondition: a filled and validated terms/source-identity confirmation file.
- The A-journal package can cite the validator as research hygiene and reproducibility infrastructure, not as new external data evidence.
- Broad source-level generalization remains blocked until this validator reports conversion-ready targets and a later no-leakage/source-CV/final-test conversion stage succeeds.
<!-- STAGE42_CG_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CH_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CH Metric/Time Claim Guard

- source: `fresh_stage42_ch_metric_time_claim_guard`
- verdict: `stage42_ch_metric_time_claim_guard_pass`
- gates: `11 / 11`
- source-specific metric/time candidates: `6`
- conversion-ready targets: `0`
- global metric claim allowed: `false`
- global seconds claim allowed: `false`
- restricted subset metric/seconds claim allowed now: `false`

Stage42-CH converts calibration evidence into enforceable paper-claim boundaries. It recognizes that ETH/UCY source-specific calibration candidates exist, including annotation-step timing that would imply h50=20s and h100=40s only for a future restricted calibrated subset. But because legal/source readiness remains zero and no restricted-subset no-leakage/source-CV/final evaluation has been run, these candidates cannot yet become paper metric/seconds results.

### Updated Gap After CH

- The project can now say: source-specific calibration candidates exist.
- The project still cannot say: M3W is metric, seconds-level, true 3D, or globally calibrated.
- The shortest path to any metric/time subset claim is: legal confirmation -> guarded conversion -> restricted calibrated subset split -> no-leakage/source-CV -> final evaluation -> report only that subset.

<!-- STAGE42_Z_POST_CH_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-Z Post-CH Claim Matrix Refresh

- source: `fresh_audit_from_stage42_wxy_and_paper_package_artifacts`
- verdict: `stage42_z_paper_claim_evidence_audit_pass`
- gates: `22 / 22`
- claim rows: `13`
- legal conversion overclaim blocked: `true`
- restricted metric/time overclaim blocked: `true`

Stage42-Z now incorporates Stage42-CG and Stage42-CH into the paper evidence matrix. The paper package can use the protected raw-frame 2.5D world-state evidence, source-level full-waypoint evidence, safety-floor necessity result, and calibrated claim-boundary infrastructure. It still cannot claim converted source-diversity repair, restricted metric/seconds subset results, true 3D, foundation-scale status, Stage5C, or SMC.

### Updated Gap After Z Post-CH

- The paper claim matrix is now explicit enough for drafting a protected 2.5D manuscript.
- The two largest publication blockers remain: legally converted independent external sources and metric/time-calibrated restricted evaluation.
- Goal/scene and neighbor/interaction remain mixed contributions rather than main positive claims.
<!-- STAGE42_Z_POST_CH_REFRESH:END -->

<!-- STAGE42_CI_REFRESH:START -->
## Stage42-CI Context Contribution Forensics

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_ablation_and_claim_audits`
- verdict: `stage42_ci_context_contribution_forensics_pass`
- gates: `13 / 13`
- dominant mechanism: `baseline_family_rollout_context`
- supported core component: `history_tokens`
- supported secondary component: `domain_expert`
- mixed / not-main components: `goal_scene_context`, `neighbor_interaction_context`
- not independent main claims: `JEPA`, `Transformer`

Stage42-CI makes the contribution boundary sharper. The current protected M3W evidence is strongest for causal baseline-family rollout context, causal sequence history, source/horizon domain conditioning, and the Stage37/teacher safety floor. Goal/scene and neighbor/interaction should be written as partial or diagnostic until a source/horizon validation-gated expert or stronger graph-neural trial proves bootstrap-positive t50/hard gains with easy preservation.

### Updated Gap After CI

- The paper can claim history and baseline-family rollout context as supported mechanisms.
- The paper should not claim uniformly positive goal/scene or interaction contributions yet.
- The next experimental route is not global context injection; it is validation-gated source/horizon experts for goal prototypes and a stronger graph-neural interaction trial under the Stage37 floor.

## Stage42-CL Post-CJ/CK Context Guard Refresh

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_cj_ck_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D paper package only.
- Stage42-CJ tested whether goal/scene context can become a validation-only gated expert over baseline-family rollout context.
- Stage42-CK tested whether scalar neighbor or kNN interaction graph context can become a validation-only gated expert.
- Both gates selected `baseline_family_control`, so goal/scene and neighbor/interaction remain diagnostic/auxiliary rather than main claims.
- This refresh updates paper-package language to prevent context overclaims.
- Stage5C remains unexecuted and SMC remains disabled.

### Claim Boundary

- Supported main mechanism remains baseline-family rollout context plus causal history under a conservative safety floor.
- Goal/scene context is not a standalone main contribution under the current source-level ridge/full-waypoint protocol.
- Neighbor/interaction context is not a standalone main contribution under the current source-level ridge/full-waypoint protocol.

## Stage42-CM Endpoint Bridge / Full-Waypoint Shape Audit

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_full_waypoint_artifacts`
- scope: protected dataset-local raw-frame 2.5D full-waypoint evidence boundary.
- Endpoint-only FDE is diagnostic; endpoint success cannot be counted as full-waypoint world-state success.
- Protected full-waypoint sequence dynamics has horizon/full-waypoint evidence, but the endpoint linear bridge remains stronger on all-ADE.
- Graph/group consistency has positive protected metrics but still carries a proximity caveat and is not an independent neighbor/interaction main claim after Stage42-CK.
- Stage5C remains unexecuted and SMC remains disabled.

- Supported: protected full-waypoint raw-frame evidence exists, especially for horizon/full-waypoint slices and unified row-level three-domain package.
- Supported with caveat: graph/group consistency can be useful inside protected policies, but current source-level kNN graph expert did not become a main contribution.
- Rejected: endpoint-only success as full-waypoint success; ungated full-waypoint neural deployment; true 3D; foundation; metric/seconds-level; Stage5C; SMC.

## Stage42-CN Bridge / Shape Composer Audit

- source: `fresh_synthesis_from_stage42_cm_j_x_artifacts`
- scope: validation-only composer feasibility for endpoint-linear bridge vs full-waypoint shape heads.
- conclusion: keep endpoint-linear bridge as deployable all-ADE floor; use full-waypoint heads only as auxiliary horizon evidence until a common validation-aligned row-level composer exists.
- blocker: common validation endpoint-vs-full-waypoint row cache is missing, so no new bridge/shape deployment switch is allowed.
- Stage5C remains unexecuted and SMC remains disabled.
